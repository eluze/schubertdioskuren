Misc. Notes:
    scan: score scanned at 600dpi
    filter: score filtered with 2-point algorithm explained in High Quality Scanning 

    I provide the original scanned version and the filtered, because the filter
does some changes (smoothening, sharpening borders) and some portions of the
scan get lost sometimes (when they are too small e.g.) - so you can choose your
favorite. You may ask me for a manually cleaned version.
